kmeans-coreset
======================================================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lpradel/kmeans-coreset.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lpradel/kmeans-coreset)

This is a heuristic C++ implementation of the constant-size coresets algorithm for *k*-means by Feldman, Schmidt and Sohler. The heuristic lies in the initial *k*-means++ sampling and the modified *k*-means++ sampling (*'DÂ²-sampling'*) in the recursive component of the original algorithm. The implementation is based on the following paper of the authors:

**Dan Feldman, Melanie Schmidt, and Christian Sohler. 2013. Turning big data into tiny data: constant-size coresets for k-means, PCA and projective clustering. In Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA '13). Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, Philadelphia, PA, USA, 1434-1453.**

## Installation

The installation process of this algorithm relies on the CMake build tool. If you are unfamiliar with CMake, the necessary steps are listed below:

### CMake

- Change into the `build` directory of the project
- Run the command `cmake ..`
- You will find the compiled binaries for Debug and Release in the `build` directory depending on your specific CMake configuration

### Dependencies

The implementation itself has no library dependencies. It does however use the **C++11** standard.

You will have to ensure the presence of a suitable compiler for this (e.g. GCC or Clang).

## Usage

You can execute the algorithm over the command line interface:

```
./kmeans-coreset input k output
```

The arguments are as follows:
- `input`: The file containing your clustering data. Data points are separated by newlines and the dimensions of a data point are delimited by a comma (`,`). See `MATRIX_FILE_DELIMITER` in `Coreset.h`
- `k`: The number of centers and clusters
- `output`: The file to store the resulting coreset. The datapoints are formatted the same as in the `input` file
